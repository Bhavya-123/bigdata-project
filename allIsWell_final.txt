LAFEU

sir,  father:    generally    times

COUNTESS

Contend  empire  thee,  thy goodness
Share  thy birthright! Love , trust  few,
 wrong  none:  able  thine enemy
Rather  power than use,  keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key:  cheque'd  silence,
 never tax'd  speech. What heaven more ,
 thee may furnish   prayers pluck down,
Fall  thy head! Farewell,  lord;
'Tis  unseason'd courtier; good  lord,
Advise .


LAFEU

LAFEU

Farewell, pretty lady:  must hold  credit 
 father.
Exeunt BERTRAM  LAFEU


HELENA

O, were  !  think    father;
 these great tears grace  remembrance more
Than those  shed  . What was  like?
  forgot :  imagination
Carries no favour 't  Bertram's.
 am undone:   no living, none,
If Bertram  away. 'Twere  
  should love  bright particular star
 think  wed ,    above :
  bright radiance  collateral light
Must   comforted,    sphere.
 ambition   love thus plagues itself:
 hind    mated   lion
Must die  love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
 see  every hour;  sit  draw
 arched brows,  hawking eye,  curls,
 our heart's table; heart too capable
 every line  trick   sweet favour:
 now 's gone,   idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify  reliques. Who comes here?
Enter PAROLLES
Aside
One  goes  :  love    sake;
 yet  know   notorious liar,
Think   great way fool, solely  coward;
Yet these fixed evils sit  fit  ,
  take place, when virtue's steely bones
Look bleak '  cold wind: withal, full oft  see
Cold wisdom waiting  superfluous folly.


PAROLLES

Save , fair queen!


HELENA

 , monarch!


PAROLLES

No.


HELENA

 no.


PAROLLES

Are  meditating  virginity?


HELENA

Ay.   some stain  soldier  : let 
ask   question. Man  enemy  virginity; how
may  barricado  against ?


PAROLLES

Keep  .


HELENA

  assails;  our virginity, though valiant,
  defence yet  weak: unfold  us some
warlike resistance.


PAROLLES

There  none: man, sitting down before , 
undermine   blow  .


HELENA

Bless our poor virginity  underminers 
blowers ! Is  no military policy, how
virgins might blow  men?


PAROLLES

Virginity being blown down, man  quicklier 
blown : marry,  blowing  down again, 
 breach yourselves made,  lose  city. 
  politic   commonwealth  nature 
preserve virginity. Loss  virginity  rational
increase   was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost.   were made  
metal  make virgins. Virginity  being once lost
may  ten times found;  being ever kept,  
ever lost: 'tis too cold  companion; away  't!


HELENA

  stand  't  little, though therefore  die  virgin.


PAROLLES

There's little can  said  't; 'tis against 
rule  nature.  speak   part  virginity,
  accuse  mothers;   most infallible
disobedience.   hangs himself   virgin:
virginity murders itself  should  buried 
highways    sanctified limit,   desperate
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
much like  cheese; consumes itself   very
paring,   dies  feeding  own stomach.
Besides, virginity  peevish, proud, idle, made 
self-love,    most inhibited sin  
canon. Keep  ;  cannot choose  loose
't:   't! within ten year   make
itself ten,    goodly increase;  
principal itself  much  worse: away  't!


HELENA

How might  , sir,  lose    own liking?


PAROLLES

Let  see: marry, ill,  like   ne'er 
likes. 'Tis  commodity  lose  gloss 
lying;  longer kept,  less worth: off  't
while 'tis vendible; answer  time  request.
Virginity, like  old courtier, wears  cap 
 fashion: richly suited,  unsuitable: just
like  brooch   tooth-pick,  wear 
now. Your date  better   pie  
porridge than   cheek;   virginity,
 old virginity,  like   our French
withered pears,  looks ill,  eats drily; marry,
'tis  withered pear;  was formerly better;
marry, yet 'tis  withered pear:   anything  ?


HELENA

  virginity yet [         ]
There shall  master   thousand loves,
 mother   mistress   friend,
 phoenix, captain   enemy,
 guide,  goddess,   sovereign,
 counsellor,  traitress,   dear;
 humble ambition, proud humility,
 jarring concord,   discord dulcet,
 faith,  sweet disaster;   world
 pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
 blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall --
 know    shall. God send  well!
 court's  learning place,    --


PAROLLES

What , ' faith?


HELENA

  wish well. 'Tis pity--


PAROLLES

What's pity?


HELENA

 wishing well had   body 't,
Which might  felt;  ,  poorer born,
Whose baser stars  shut us   wishes,
Might  effects  them follow our friends,
 show   alone must think,  never
Return us thanks.

thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
thou hast leisure,  thy prayers; when thou hast
none, remember thy friends;  thee  good husband,
 use    uses thee; , farewell.

HELENA

Our remedies oft  ourselves  lie,
Which  ascribe  heaven:  fated sky
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when  ourselves  dull.
What power    mounts  love  high,
 makes  see,  cannot feed mine eye?
 mightiest space  fortune nature brings
 join like likes  kiss like native things.
Impossible  strange attempts  those
 weigh  pains  sense   suppose
What hath been cannot :  ever strove
 show  merit,  did miss  love?
 king's disease-- project may deceive ,
  intents  fix'd    leave .

Prejudicates  business   seem

First Lord

   Count Rousillon,  good lord,
Young Bertram.


KING

                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
Frank nature, rather curious than  haste,
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome  Paris.


BERTRAM

My thanks  duty   majesty's.


KING

   had  corporal soundness now,
 when thy father  myself  friendship
First tried our soldiership!  did look far
Into  service   time  was
Discipled   bravest:  lasted long;

Till  own scorn return  them unnoted
Ere  can hide  levity  honour;
 like  courtier, contempt nor bitterness
Were   pride  sharpness;   were,

Clock  itself, knew  true minute when
Exception bid  speak,    time

 used  creatures  another place
 bow'd  eminent top   low ranks,
Making them proud   humility,
  poor praise  humbled. Such  man
Might   copy  these younger times;
Which, follow'd well,  demonstrate them now

BERTRAM

Lies richer   thoughts than   tomb;
  approof lives   epitaph

KING

Would  were  !   always --
Methinks  hear  now;  plausive words
 scatter'd   ears,  grafted them,
 grow    bear,--'Let   live,'--
  good melancholy oft began,
  catastrophe  heel  pastime,
When  was ,--'Let   live,' quoth ,
'After  flame lacks oil,    snuff
 younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All  new things disdain; whose judgments 
Mere fathers   garments; whose constancies
Expire before  fashions.'   wish'd;

Since  nor wax nor honey can bring home,

Since  physician   father's died?

Debate    leisure. Welcome, count;
My son's no dearer.


BERTRAM

Thank  majesty.

Madam,  was very late more near  than  think

 herself  own words   own ears; 
thought,  dare vow  ,  touched  any
stranger sense.  matter was,  loved  son:
Fortune,  said, was no goddess,  had put
such difference betwixt  two estates; Love no
god,    extend  might, only where
qualities were level; Dian no queen  virgins, 
 suffer  poor knight surprised, without
rescue   first assault  ransom afterward.
  delivered   most bitter touch 
sorrow  e'er  heard virgin exclaim :  
held  duty speedily  acquaint  withal;
sithence,   loss  may happen,  concerns

Then,  confess,
Here   knee, before high heaven  ,

My friends were poor,  honest; 's  love:
  offended;   hurts

Nor     till   deserve ;
Yet never know how  desert should .
 know  love  vain, strive against hope;
Yet   captious  intenible sieve

Religious  mine error,  adore

 knows   no more. My dearest madam,
Let   hate encounter   love
 loving where  :   yourself,
Whose aged honour cites  virtuous youth,
Did ever   true  flame  liking
Wish chastely  love dearly,   Dian
Was both herself  love: O, then, give pity

Are   mind; ,   cannot help ,

When our most learned doctors leave us

When judges  been babes; great floods  flown

When miracles    greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails  most oft 
Where most  promises,  oft  hits
Where hope  coldest  despair most fits.

Thy pains  used must  thyself  paid:

Methinks  thee some blessed spirit doth speak

Thy life  dear;    life can rate
Worth name  life  thee hath estimate,
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage,

Thou   hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite  monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser, thy physic   try,

KING

Ay,   sceptre   hopes  heaven.

Then shalt thou give   thy kingly hand
What husband  thy power   command:
Exempted     arrogance

Though more  know could   more  trust,

Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU,  two French Lords,  Attendants


KING

 lost  jewel  ;  our esteem
Was made much poorer  :   son,
 mad  folly, lack'd  sense  know
 estimation home.


COUNTESS

'Tis past,  liege;
  beseech  majesty  make 
Natural rebellion, done '  blaze  youth;
When oil  fire, too strong  reason's force,
O'erbears   burns .


KING

My honour'd lady,
  forgiven  forgotten ;
Though  revenges were high bent upon ,
 watch'd  time  shoot.


LAFEU

  must ,
 first  beg  pardon,  young lord
Did   majesty,  mother   lady
Offence  mighty note;   himself
 greatest wrong  .  lost  wife
Whose beauty did astonish  survey
 richest eyes, whose words  ears took captive,
Whose dear perfection hearts  scorn'd  serve
Humbly call'd mistress.


KING

Praising   lost
Makes  remembrance dear. Well, call  hither;
  reconciled,   first view shall kill
All repetition: let   ask our pardon;
 nature   great offence  dead,
 deeper than oblivion   bury
 incensing relics  : let  approach,
 stranger, no offender;  inform 
 'tis our   should.


Gentleman

 shall,  liege.
Exit


KING

What says    daughter?   spoke?


LAFEU

All    hath reference   highness.


KING

Then shall    match.   letters sent

Enter BERTRAM


LAFEU

 looks well 't.


KING

 am   day  season,
 thou mayst see  sunshine   hail
   once:    brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way;  stand thou forth;
 time  fair again.


BERTRAM

My high-repented blames,
Dear sovereign, pardon  .


KING

All  whole;
  word more   consumed time.
Let's take  instant   forward top;
   old,   our quick'st decrees
 inaudible  noiseless foot  Time
Steals ere  can effect them.  remember
 daughter   lord?


BERTRAM

Admiringly,  liege,  first
 stuck  choice upon , ere  heart
Durst make too bold  herald   tongue
Where  impression  mine eye infixing,
Contempt  scornful perspective did lend ,
Which warp'd  line  every other favour;
Scorn'd  fair colour,  express'd  stolen;
Extended  contracted  proportions
  most hideous object: thence  came
  whom  men praised  whom myself,
Since   lost,  loved, was  mine eye
 dust  did offend .


KING

Well excused:
 thou didst love , strikes some scores away
  great compt:  love  comes too late,
Like  remorseful pardon slowly carried,
  great sender turns  sour offence,
Crying, ''s good 's gone.' Our rash faults
Make trivial price  serious things  ,
 knowing them until  know  grave:
Oft our displeasures,  ourselves unjust,
Destroy our friends  after weep  dust
Our own love waking cries  see 's done,
While shame full late sleeps   afternoon.
  sweet Helen's knell,  now forget .
Send forth  amorous token  fair Maudlin:
 main consents  had;  here 'll stay
 see our widower's second marriage-day.


COUNTESS

Which better than  first, O dear heaven, bless!
, ere  meet,  , O nature, cesse!


LAFEU

Come ,  son,  whom  house's name
Must  digested, give  favour  
 sparkle   spirits   daughter,
  may quickly come.
BERTRAM gives  ring
  old beard,
 every hair 's 't, Helen, 's dead,
Was  sweet creature: such  ring  ,
 last  e'er  took   court,
 saw upon  finger.


BERTRAM

Hers  was .


KING

Now, pray , let  see ;  mine eye,
While  was speaking, oft was fasten'd 't.
 ring was mine; , when  gave  Helen,
 bade ,   fortunes ever stood
Necessitied  help,    token
  relieve . Had   craft,  reave

  should stead  most?


BERTRAM

My gracious sovereign,
Howe'er  pleases   take  ,
 ring was never hers.


COUNTESS

Son,   life,
  seen  wear ;   reckon'd 
  life's rate.


LAFEU

 am sure  saw  wear .


BERTRAM

  deceived,  lord;  never saw :
 Florence was    casement thrown ,
Wrapp'd   paper,  contain'd  name
   threw : noble  was,  thought
 stood engaged:  when  had subscribed
 mine own fortune  inform'd  fully
 could  answer   course  honour
  had made  overture,  ceased
 heavy satisfaction   never
Receive  ring again.


KING

Plutus himself,
 knows  tinct  multiplying medicine,
Hath   nature's mystery more science
Than     ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
Whoever gave  . Then,   know
   well acquainted  yourself,
Confess 'twas hers,    rough enforcement
 got   :  call'd  saints  surety
   never put    finger,
Unless  gave   yourself  bed,
Where   never come,  sent  us
Upon  great disaster.


BERTRAM

 never saw .


KING

Thou speak'st  falsely,   love mine honour;
 makest conjectural fears  come into 
Which   fain shut . If  should prove
 thou art  inhuman,--'twill  prove ;--
 yet  know : thou didst hate  deadly,
   dead;  nothing,   close
 eyes myself, could win   believe,
More than  see  ring. Take  away.
Guards seize BERTRAM
My fore-past proofs, howe'er  matter fall,
Shall tax  fears  little vanity,
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away  !
'll sift  matter further.


BERTRAM

If  shall prove
 ring was ever hers,  shall  easy
Prove   husbanded  bed  Florence,
Where yet  never was.
